# Topics to Cover

## Interfaces

- What are they?
- How to define them?
- Why needed?
  - list type
  - variable type
  - method parameter
  - return type
  - **reduce dependency b/w classes** classes using the interface, only depend on the interface--they don't need to change when the classes implementing the interface changes or more classes implement the inteface
- What is polymorphism?
- Hierarchy
- Interface as a variable type
- We are sure that any class that implement the interface will have all the methods defined in the interface.
- **Interface Programming**: implementing programs so data structures are used through interfaces

- Interfaces **define**, don't implement, methods
- Classes **implements** interfaces

## Inheritance

- What is it?
- Why needed?
- Superclass/subclass
- Final class
- Final method
- Access modifiers: private, public, protected, <unspecified>
- Abstract class
- Heirarchy
- `super` constructor
  - its location
- `super` keyward
